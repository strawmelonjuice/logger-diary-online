# Logger-Diary.Online
The simple diary, but now with a separated server and client side approach, making cross-device functionality possible.

##  What is this?

*Logger-Diary* is a small diary program that I made because truly, I had no better options available. I'm glad to have changed that now. *This*, however, is Logger-Diary **Online**, which means a faster cross-device and safer experience!

### Mar!

OH- I'm sorry, I forgot to announce myself, how impolite! I am Mar, you can find more of my brain on [this page](https://strawmelonjuice.com/), or see more of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice)!

## The history of this project

This was actually one of the first things I put together!

When I was 11 years old and wanted a diary software program, but couldn't find one, I began working on an idea of what it should be like.

I was also a bit of a FreeDOS fan, and I'd collect old laptops that couldn't handle modern OS's anymore and turn them into DOS devices.

At some point I made a CLI-ish program that'd list entries and at the bottom of that list would allow you to add one, along with an emotion (no emoji in DOS) and it would select the right time itself.

A few years later, that small 2kb DOS program turned into this website, and I turned 19 a while back. (written December 12th 2022, I was born 2003-10-08)

It's been a real travel, and I am happy to be here. I hope you are too.
